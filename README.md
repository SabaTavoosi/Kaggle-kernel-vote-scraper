Things to fix/add in future updates:  

1. Fix current bug in the online app where the valid vote gauge sometimes does not display the gauge when starting the app. If a new kernel URL is inputted or one goes to the "About" page and then back to the "Vote scraper" the gauge will display.
2. Add total views  
3. Add vote to fork ratio  
4. Add view to vote ratio
